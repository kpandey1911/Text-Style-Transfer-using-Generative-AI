# 📝 Text Style Transfer using Generative AI

A GenAI-based NLP project that transforms the style of a given sentence — for example, from casual to formal, passive to active — using a pre-trained T5 transformer model.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of pre-trained transformer models for **text style transfer**, where the content of the text is preserved but the tone or structure is changed. The app provides an interactive web interface powered by **Streamlit**.

## 🎯 Features

- 🔁 Paraphrasing
- ✍️ Formalization of casual text
- 📢 Passive to active voice transformation
- 📝 Summarization (optional)
- 🧠 Powered by HuggingFace Transformers (`t5-small`)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- HuggingFace Transformers
- Streamlit
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

🧠 Model Used

  T5-small — A lightweight, pre-trained text-to-text transformer model from Google.

🔍 Future Enhancements

  Add more style options (e.g., sarcastic, poetic).

   Fine-tune T5 on a style transfer dataset.

  Support multi-language inputs.

  Add feedback-based learning for better personalization.
